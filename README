This is a simple framework to test the "Request a demo" form.

I have used a page object model with separate test and page layer.

It is easy to add more pages and tests.

Room for improvement:

- Add cucumber support
- Add multiple browser support
- Add test data handling
- Use WebDriverManager or other library to programmatically maintain the browser/driver versions
- Add ability to run the tests in parallel
- Add logging capabilities
